We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL
2.5.2.

This version fixes a regression where dropping a database on PostgreSQL
didn't work properly anymore as well as several other issues.

You can find all the changes on JIRA:

-   [DBAL
    2.5.2](https://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10731)
    - 24 issues fixed

You can install the DBAL using Composer and the following
`composer.json` contents:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/dbal": "2.5.2"
    }
}
```

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](https://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
