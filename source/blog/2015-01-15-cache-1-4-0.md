We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Cache
1.4.0.

This release fixes a series of performance and compatibility issues in
the filesystem-based cache adapters
([\#16](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/16),
[\#50](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/50),
[\#55](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/55)).

New cache adapters for `SQlite3`
([\#32](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/32)) and `Predis`
([\#28](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/28)) were implemented.

A new `ChainCache` ([\#52](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/52))
was implemented, allowing multiple levels of caching, for performance
and efficiency.

New interfaces were introduced, for better interface segregation and
improved performance:

-   `MultiGetCache` ([\#29](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/29))
-   `FlushableCache` ([\#48](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/48))
-   `ClearableCache` ([\#48](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/48))

This release also causes the filesystem-based caches to change directory
structure for saved files: please clear your file-based caches
completely before upgrading.

You can find the complete changelog for this release in the [release
notes](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

You can install the Cache component using Composer and the following
`composer.json` contents:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/cache": "1.4.0"
    }
}
```

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](https://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
