We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Cache
[1.4.3](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.4.3) and
[1.5.0](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

Cache 1.4.3
===========

This release fixes some minor issues that prevented various cache
adapters from correctly reporting success or failure in case of cache
key deletion ([\#95](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/95)).

Another issue being fixed is related to `CacheProvider#fetchMultiple()`,
which was failing to operate when an empty list was given to it
([\#90](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/90)).

Also, the `CacheProvider` does not store version information internally
unless `CacheProvider#deleteAll()` was called at least once
([\#91](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/91)).

You can find the complete changelog for this release in the [v1.4.3
release notes](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.4.3).

Cache 1.5.0
===========

This release includes all the changes released with version 1.4.3, as
well as further bug fixes and improvements that will require you to
clean your caches (if file-based) during the upgrade.

PHP7 support is now guaranteed
([\#92](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/92)).

File based caches now use a much lower number of directories
([\#94](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/94)).

Proper support for wincache multi-get was added
([\#97](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/97)).

Predis cache adapter now relies on the `Predis\ClientInterface`
([\#87](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/87)).

You can find the complete changelog for this release in the [v1.5.0
release notes](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.0).
