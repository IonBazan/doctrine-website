We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL
[2.5.3](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/v2.5.3).

The SQLServer platform support for pagination query modification was
completely rewritten, improving stability and code quality as well as
ease of maintenance.
[\#818](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/818)

Dependency constraints on the
[doctrine/common](https://github.com/doctrine/common) component
supported versions were corrected, allowing users to install
`doctrine/common` `2.6.*` together with the DBAL.
[\#2268](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2268)

============

You can install the DBAL component using Composer:

composer require doctrine/dbal:~2.5.3
