We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine
Collections `1.2.4`.

This release fixes a minor issue
([\#51](https://github.com/doctrine/annotations/pull/51)) with highly
concurrent I/O and the `FileCacheReader#saveCacheFile()` method.

Installation
============

You can install this version of Doctrine Annotations by using Composer
and the following `composer.json` contents:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/annotations": "1.2.4"
    }
}
```

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](https://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DCOM).
