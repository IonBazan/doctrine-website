We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL
2.4.4 and 2.5.1. Various bugs that prevented users from upgrading to
DBAL 2.5.x have been fixed in DBAL 2.5.1, along with some others. DBAL
2.4.4 only contains backported bug fixes addressed since the release of
DBAL 2.5.0.

The index renaming feature introduced in DBAL 2.5.0 caused trouble for
some MySQL users utilizing ORM's schema tool to upgrade their schemas
where the schema tool was generating invalid `DROP INDEX` /
`CREATE INDEX` SQL. Fixing this issue was only possible by introducing a
minor BC break (change in behaviour), please see `UPGRADE.md` for more
information (we know that this is a patch release but we are actually
reverting a BC break here). MariaDB users had problems upgrading to DBAL
2.5.0 because of the new platform detection feature not taking MariaDB
backends into account. Additionally, some minor bugs around schema
creation / introspection and DDL in various platforms were fixed.

Please note that this release does `not yet` include a fix for users
having problems with the DBAL connection not being lazy anymore since
DBAL 2.5.0 when retrieving the underlying platform. Unfortunately we did
not find a good solution for this issue yet. Until the issue is fixed
please directly set the platform version as a workaround by using the
`serverVersion` configuration option described in the
[documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/current/reference/configuration.html#automatic-platform-version-detection)
if you are encountering any problems.
