We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL
[2.5.4](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/v2.5.4) and
[2.4.5](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/v2.4.5).

DBAL 2.5.4
==========

SQLite types weren't correctly identified when whitespace was present in
the table definitions: the DBAL now correctly recognizes that, and
ignores the whitespace.
[\#2272](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2272)

constant `PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES` is only defined when PGSQL
support for PHP is enabled with PDO. The DBAL now checks whether the
constant is available before relying on it.
[\#2249](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2249)

DBAL 2.4.5
==========

This release backports a number of fixes that were already present in
DBAL 2.5.3.

Specifically, following issues were solved:

-   SQLite offset with no limit support
    [\#1069](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1069)
-   Fix removing autoincrement column from a primary key
    [\#1074](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1074)
-   Infinite recursion on non-unique table/join alias in QueryBuilder
    [\#1079](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1079)
-   Fix for bad profiling data, showing an indefinitely long query
    [\#1124](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1124)
-   Fix incorrect ordering of columns in clustered indexes on sql server
    [\#1129](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1129)
-   Avoid fatal error in `array_merge` while generating the table
    creation SQL [\#1141](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1141)
-   `template1` as default database for PostgreSQL
    [\#1162](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1162)

Please be advised that this is the last 2.4.x release, and except for
security releases, no further patches will be provided for DBAL 2.4:
please upgrade to 2.5 as soon as possible.
