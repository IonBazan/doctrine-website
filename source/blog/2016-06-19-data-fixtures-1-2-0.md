We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine
Data-Fixtures
[1.2.0](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

This release fixes an issue that prevented further development of
`doctrine/orm`, since an internal class of the ORM was used inside the
`doctrine/data-fixtures` package. This issue is now solved by
implementing a custom `` `TopologicalSorter ``
\<[https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/blob/v1.2.0/lib/Doctrine/Common/DataFixtures/Sorter/TopologicalSorter.php](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/blob/v1.2.0/lib/Doctrine/Common/DataFixtures/Sorter/TopologicalSorter.php)\>\`\_
in the library.
[\#222](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/pull/222)

Additionally an issue with double escaping caused issues when deleting
from tables with quoted names.
[\#221](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/pull/221)

Please also be aware that this release drops support for PHP 5.5 and
below. Given that PHP 5.5 is going to exit its official [security
support schedule](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) very soon, we
strongly recommend that all users upgrade their PHP installations as
well.

Installation
============

You can install the ORM component using Composer:

```bash
composer require doctrine/data-fixtures:^1.2.0
```

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/issues).
