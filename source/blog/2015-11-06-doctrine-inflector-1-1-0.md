We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine
Inflector
[1.1.0](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

This release adds a feature that allows to upper-case words separated by
a custom delimiter
([\#11](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/11)).

We discovered that heroes, buffalo and tomatoes have something in common
([\#18](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/18)).

"criteria" and "criterion" plural and singular form were reversed: now
fixed ([\#19](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/19)).

Additional inflections were introduced for more irregular forms
([\#20](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/20)
[\#22](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/22)
[\#24](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/24)).

Last but not least, we now explicitly support and test against PHP 7
([\#21](https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/21)).
