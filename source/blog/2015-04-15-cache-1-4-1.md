We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Cache
1.4.1.

This release fixes a series of bugs related with `null`, `false` or
truncated data in the `SQLite3` and `Memcache` adapters
([\#62](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/62),
[\#65](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/65),
[\#67](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/67)).

Improvements have been made to reduce the `SQLite3` cache adapter memory
usage ([\#64](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/64)).

If you use an opcode cache such as OPCache (available since PHP 5.5),
you will get major performance improvements in read operations in the
`PhpFileCache`, which shouldn't cause any stat calls at all now
([\#69](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/69)).

Multi-get support was built into the `Redis` adapter
([\#60](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/60)).

A new `VoidCache` adapter has been introduced - useful for testing
([\#61](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/61)).

You can find the complete changelog for this release in the [release
notes](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.4.1).

You can install the Cache component using Composer and the following
`composer.json` contents:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/cache": "1.4.1"
    }
}
```

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](https://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
