The **Zend Framework Integration Team** is happy to announce the new
release of **DoctrineMongoODMModule**. DoctrineMongoODMModule `0.8.2`
will be the last bugfix version with support for **DoctrineModule**
`0.8`, and in consequence, it is the last version that will support PHP
5.3. Further versions of the `0.8.*` series may still be released in
case of security issues.

Following issues were solved in this release:

-   [108 - applying correct chmod() to generated cache
    file](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule/pull/108)
-   [109 - added user
    guide](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule/pull/109)
-   [114 - simplified unit
    testing](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule/pull/114)
-   [115 - removed files for old test
    setup](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule/pull/115)

To install this version, simply update your \`composer.json\`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/doctrine-mongo-odm-module": "0.8.2"
    }
}
```
