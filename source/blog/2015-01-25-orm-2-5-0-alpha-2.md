We are happy to announce the immediate availability Doctrine ORM
`2.5.0-alpha2`.

This is a pre-release meant to allow users and contributors to try out
the new upcoming features of the ORM.

We encourage all of our users to help us by trying out this alpha
release. Please report any possible problems or incompatibilities that
may have been introduced during development.

This pre-release is not yet at feature-freeze, therefore we urge
contributors to contact us if there is any change that requires our
attention before we reach the beta (feature-freeze) release stage.

What is new in 2.5.x?
=====================

We are currently in the process of documenting all the changes and new
features that were introduced in Doctrine ORM 2.5.x.

You can find the current state of the 2.5.0 changes overview in [the
upgrade
notes](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/changelog/migration_2_5.html).

-   `2.5.0` on `2015-02-16`
